Multi-Line Comments

You can write a comment that spans multiple lines by starting each line with a #, but there's an easier way. 
If you start with =begin and end with =end, everything between those two expressions will be a comment. 

Take a look at this example:
Don't put any space between the = sign and the words begin or end. You can do that with math (2 + 5 is the same as 2+5), 
but in this case, Ruby will get confused. =begin and =end also need to be on lines all by themselves, just as shown above.
=end
