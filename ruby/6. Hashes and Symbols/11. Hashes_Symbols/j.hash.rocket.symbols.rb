All Aboard the Hash Rocket!

The hash syntax you've seen so far (with the => symbol between keys and values) is sometimes nicknamed the hash rocket style.

numbers = {
  :one => 1,
  :two => "two",
  :three => 3,
}

This is because the => looks like a tiny rocket!

Let's build a hash from the ground up using symbols as keys.
Instructions

    Create a hash called movies with symbols as keys and strings as values.
    Inside your hash, add two key/value pairs.
    The keys should be the names of movies.
    The values should be quick descriptions or reviews.

Hint

You could have a hash where the keys/values look like this:

{
  :primer => "Awesome",
  :memento => "Not as good the 2nd time",
}

movies = {
    :the_lone_survivor => "Classic",
    :silver_strand     => "Classic",
}
