A Key of a Different Color

We can certainly use strings as Ruby hash keys; as we've seen, there's always more than one way to do something in Ruby. However, the Rubyist's approach would be to use symbols.
Instructions

Check out the code in the editor. Those funny-looking variables that start with colons are symbols. Click Save & Submit Code to see what happens, then head to the next section for a symbol rundown.

menagerie = { :foxes => 2,
  :giraffe => 1,
  :weezards => 17,
  :elves => 1,
  :canaries => 4,
  :ham => 1
}

# Output:
{:foxes=>2, :giraffe=>1, :weezards=>17, :elves=>1, :canaries=>4, :ham=>1}
