Symbol Syntax

Symbols always start with a colon (:). They must be valid Ruby variable names, so the first character after the colon has to be a letter or underscore (_); after that, any combination of letters, numbers, and underscores is allowed.

Make sure you don't put any spaces in your symbol name—if you do, Ruby will get confused.

:my symbol # Don't do this!
:my_symbol # Do this instead.

Instructions

All right! Time to create your first symbol. Create a regular old variable called my_first_symbol and set it equal to any valid symbol you like!
?
Hint

If you're stuck, try

my_first_symbol = :starmonkey
=end

# Write your code below!

my_first_symbol = :star_topix
